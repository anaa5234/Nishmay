                    Nishmay, the daughter of Viswakarma, a divine cosmic architect known for his flawless magical creativity. She inherited Viswakarma's divine talents and imaginative powers to craft and design flawlessly. Nishmay's name comes from the Sanskrit words "Nishkalank" and "Mayan" meaning illusion or magic.

                    At Nishmay, we see a future where Varanasi wood carving will no longer go unnoticed, where the carvers will be recognised as the pride of indiaâ€™s culture and the legacy of the craft will continue for generations to come.

                <p>
                    It is our mission to encourage the young generation of India to take up this craft, explore and spread it through the youth. Every Indian should acknowledge this craft and recognise the difference Varanasi wood carving has from others like Lacquer or Jaipur wood carving. To have the artisans get due credit and recognition for their artistry and finesse. And have the legacy of the craft be known to every citizen there is.

                        Nishmay is a website that educates the art enthusiasts and the curious minds. It tells them the Why and hows of the craft of Varanasi wood carving. There are people who remain unaware of the authenticity of this centuries old craft and are unable to distinguish them from the several others that are no doubt exclusive but yet not the same. This website will empower them to realise the difference and let due credit be paid to the artisans.
